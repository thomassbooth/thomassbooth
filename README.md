I predominantly upload my learning here and keep my projects private

:computer: Machine learning engineer forced to write in Python with a special love for Golang.

Currently working on a kubernetes cluster management system for managing ML Workloads/experiments, Benchmarking, Model deployment/Inferencing, Finetuning and more.

:writing_hand: Mathematics is cool, anyone who says otherwise is wrong :)
